## Description

This is my portfolio to showcase my skills and talents to future employers. This will act as my online resume to show my current (and future) projects. 

I learned a great deal on how to utilize React when rebuilding my portfolio (you can find my orginal one [here](https://itsa-me-dea.github.io/02-Challenge-myPortfolio/), can't say I'm too happy with this one). I found that React is a lot more versatile than Handlebars, so I hope to do more work with React in the future .
